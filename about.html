        Hi and welcome! I am
        currently a fourth-year doctoral candidate at the University of Southern
        California’s <a href="https://dornsife-poir.usc.edu/">Department
        of Political Science and International Relations</a> and a research 
        associate at the <a href="https://www.uscspec.org/">Security and Political Economy Lab 
        (SPEC)</a>. Here, my primary areas of academic research include legislative institutions,
        political communication, race and ethnicity, social media and politics,
        and computational social science. Prior to joining the program, I
        completed my undergraduate studies and obtained my Bachelor's degree
        in Political Science at <a href="https://cla.csulb.edu/departments/polisci/">
        California State University, Long Beach</a> and then moved on to obtain
        my Master of Public Policy at the University of Southern
        California’s <a href="https://priceschool.usc.edu/">Sol Price School
        of Public Policy</a>–where I specialized in Applied Econometrics,
        Health, and Environmental Policy. Outside of academia, I enjoy
        programming, learning
        new languages, traveling, and amateur photography. I have
        shared some of the pictures that I have taken over my travels in the 
        Photography section, hoping they provide some cool amusement and inspiration.</p>
