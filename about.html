        Welcome to my website! <br> <br>

        I am a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://dornsife-poir.usc.edu/">
        Political Science and International Relations</a> program 
        at University of Southern California. At USC, my core subfields are International 
        Relations and Comparative Politics with a third field specialty in Intersectional 
        Approaches to International Law and Migration Policy and Politics.  Prior to my entry 
        into the PhD program, I obtained my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.ucla.edu/">
        UCLA</a>, my first masters at USC's <a href="https://priceschool.usc.edu/">Sol Price 
        School of Public Policy</a>, and then my second masters from <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">
        UC Berkeley</a> in 2020. Prior to eventually returning to academics, I spent several 
        years working for international humanitarian and advocacy NGOs, for the US Department 
        of State abroad in refugee affairs and migration policy, and in university education 
        administration. My current research lands at the intersection of law, migration, and 
        international policy and specifically focuses on asylum jurisprudence and migration 
        policy diffusion. <br> <br>

        Outside of academia, I enjoy spending my time traveling, exploring hidden parts of any 
        city that I'm in, learning languages, being outdoors, enjoying good live music, 
        cooking new cultural cuisines, and discovering (and rediscovering) some of my now 
        favorite films.
